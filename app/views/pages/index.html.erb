<p>
  All attendees, sponsors, partners, volunteers and staff at our hackathon are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organisers will enforce this code throughout the event. We are expecting cooperation from all participants to help ensuring a safe environment for everybody.

<h2>The Quick Version</h2>

<p>
  Our hackathon is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack of any of the formentioned). We do not tolerate harassment of hackathon participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate at any hackathon venue, including hacks, talks, workshops, parties, social media and other online media. Hackathon participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the hackathon without a refund at the discretion of the hackathon organisers.
</p>

<h2>
  The Less Quick Version
</h2>

<p>
  Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
</p>

<p>
  Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
</p>

<p>
  As this is a hackathon we like to explicitly note that the hacks created at our hackathon are equally subjective to the anti-harassment policy.
</p>

<p>
  Sponsors and partners are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Sponsor representatives (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.
</p>

<p>
  If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the hackathon organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the hackathon with no refund.
</p>

<p>
  If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of hackathon staff immediately.
</p>

<p>
  Hackathon staff will be happy to help participants contact any local security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the hackathon. We value your attendance.
</p>

<p>
  Hackathon participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the hackathon without a refund at the discretion of the hackathon organisers.
</p>

<p>
  We expect participants to follow these rules at hackathon and workshop venues and hackathon-related social events.
